Currently just my emacs.d, largely based on https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure

# TODO
- [x] vim-like open splits navigation
- [ ] evil-leader key
- [ ] Smooth scrolling
- [ ] Emacs daemon always running
- [ ] Markdown mode
- [ ] NeoTree with evil
- [x] why does ibuffer accept "d", but then requires "x" to apply?

# Things to get done to replace PyCharm
- [ ] Projectile
- [ ] evil-jedi
- [ ] rename across the project
- [ ] find string as regex within the project, filter by certain file type
- [ ] auto collapse on function/class level
