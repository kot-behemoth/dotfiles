Currently just my emacs.d, largely based on https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure

# TODO
- [x] vim-like open splits navigation
- [x] evil-leader key
- [x] Smooth scrolling
- [x] Markdown mode
- [ ] Emacs daemon always running
- [ ] NeoTree with evil

# Things to get done to replace PyCharm
- [x] find string as regex within the project, filter by certain file type (rgrep-mode, duh)
- [ ] Projectile
- [ ] evil-jedi
- [ ] rename across the project
- [ ] auto collapse on function/class level
